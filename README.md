## About

This project is a React Starter Project to be used for my personal work. It also a playground to me to learn about React.

I use this starter as a barebone for a new static react app project that uses CRA. The directories and files are following this structure:
```
[project]
    root project files (readme, package.json,etc)
    
    [public]
        - index.html (and favicon, etc)  
    
    [src]
        [_DummyData] (put your dummy data here)
            - DummyDataFile.js
        [_SCSS] (your global, settings & vars _scss will be her)
            - variables.scss
            - colors.scss
            - etc
        [Components] (your components will be here)
            [Button]
                - Button.js
                - button.scss (component spesific styles)
            [other components]
        [Pages] (layout, pages/views are here)
            [Layout] (here is the master layouts)
                - DefaultLayout.js
                - Userlayout.js
                - etc.
            [Member] (member area/specific area for specific parts of the views)
                - Member.js
                - Account.js
            - Home.js
