## Components

Here will be where components created. The ideal setup for directories of the components would be a folder for each component. 

Each folder will consist of at least two separate files: 
* `Component.js` - the component file. 
* `component.scss` - where all the styles declared.

Component is the smallest building block of your app, try to create a component as small as possible. example: Button component, ButtonGroup component, Header Component, Sidebar Component, etc.
